# Requirements
# - Define a Student class with 2 instance attributes (name, age) and 1 class attribute (educational_platform = udemy);
# - Make it so that instances of Student could be created by simply specifying the name. Hint: set the default age to a number
# - Define a greet() method which alternates between various name greetings. When invoked, the method should randomly select
# a greeting and interpolate in the name of the student
#        - Hi, I'm...
#        - Hey there, my name is...
#        - Hi. Oh, my name is...
# - Starting with a list of several student names, create student instances from each, and have each student introduce themselves

# Example Usage
# s1 = Student("Alice")
# s1.greet()
# "Hi, I'm Alice"

# for i in range(4):
#     print(s1.greet())

# Hey there, my name is Alice
# Hey there, my name is Alice
# Hi, I'm Alice
# Hi. Oh, my name is Alice

# s1.age
# 34
