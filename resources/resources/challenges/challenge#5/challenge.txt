## CHALLENGE 5 ##
#################

# # Requirements:
# - Define a new type called DNABase which takes a single arg (nucleotide) at initiation
# - Internally the value specified in the nucleotide arg should be validated and standardized
# - The class should expose an attribute called base
# - The class should not expose a nucleotide attribute
# - The valid bases are: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine
# - A user should be able to specify either the full name as above, or the first letter, case insensitively
# - The name exposed under the base attribute should be the full name in lowercase regardless of how it was specified
# - Invalid or otherwise unrecognized bases should be rejected, whether they are specified at instance creation or
# later altered through attribute setters
# - The new type should have a full representation

# Example Usage:
# b1 = DNABase('A')
# b1
# DNABase(nucleotide='adenine')

# b1.base
# 'adenine'

# b1.nucleotide
# AttributeError: 'DNABase' object has no attribute 'nucleotide'

# b1.base = 'c'
# b1
# DNABase(nucleotide='cytosine')

# b1.base = "Aoli"
# ValueError: Aoli is not a recognized DNA nucleotide

# DNABase("aol")
# ValueError: aol is not a recognized DNA nucleotide

# b1.base = "thYMIne"
# b1
# DNABase(nucleotide='thymine')
